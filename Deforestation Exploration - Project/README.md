The project was done in the Nanodegree Course of SQL in Udacity.

Goals were to practice: Joins, temporal tables (create a view, with), using filters and SQL syntaxis.

The goal was to analyze data to reduce deforestation worldwide and raise awareness about this important
environmental topic. First, by cleaning any erroneous values in a table, join that table to another lookup table to bring in a new
categorical and quantitative variable and return a new view of all categories greater than a reference value. Then, creating
and executing SQL queries to perform calculations using variables from those disparate data sets to answer questions 
for stakeholders. The analysis helped me better understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have
forests that have been shrinking in size and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area. 
Lastly, I did compile my answers and summarized my analysis into a report that can be shared with a leadership team.
