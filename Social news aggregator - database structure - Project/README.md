The project was done in the Nanodegree Course of SQL in Udacity.

The goals were to practice: Normalizing data, Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Constraints, and Indexes.

In this project, I have to build the supporting data structures for Uddidit, a social media news
aggregator site. First, I investigated the provided data model for potential errors such as lack of normalization, 
consistency rules, and proper indexing. Then, I created a new, normalized database using DDL based on the denormalized one 
provided. Lastly, I wrote DML queries to migrate the data from the denormalized schema to their normalized schema.
